This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Challenge 1 - Light Bulb Challenge

As a user I can see a square on the screen with the word 'off' in the middle.

As a user I can click anywhere on the square. When I click the square the words change from 'off' to 'on' and then back 'off' again.

## Stretch ##
As a user, when I click the box the color goes from white to yellow. (still with the words on or off in the middle)

## Super Stretch ##
As a user, instead of seeing a box, I see a picture of a light switch in the off position and a white light bulb.

As a user, when I click on the light switch it turns on and the light bulb changes from white to yellow.

## Epic Stretch ##
As a user I see multiple different lightbulbs and switches that act independently of each other.

As a user I can add or remove a light switch/bulb from the webpage. (this is iceboxed)
